## Hi there 👋

<p/>🙋‍♀️ Art'Portal is a french discord server which goal is to propose free graphism services to everyone.
<p/>🌈 Anyone can contribute ! If you need any support or help or idk, just join our server and feel free to ask !
<p/>👩‍💻 This Github organisation currently contains our private discord bot, Aprıl, which is now open-source !
<p/>🍿 Fun facts:
<ul>
  <li>@Ninjdai1 (The guy with the chicken pp) is veggie</li>
  <li>Aprıl contains a special character (ı) because when we tried to give her the name April, it was already taken by 10k accounts, so :( no room for her. It does look cool, though.</li>
 </ul>
